import example2

example2.welcome()     # this will execute the function twice first time because we literally called the function here so it's as usual but second time because the python file also called the function inside that file
# note: even if you don't call the function explicitly but imports the python file still the code inside that python file will execute and the function will be called so stay cautious when running or importing modules from third party

# but the solution for this is in the example2.py file
